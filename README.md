Real-Time Chat Application

A full-stack real-time chat application built using Next.js, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Socket.IO.

The app includes user authentication (signup & login) using JWT, protected routes, and real-time messaging with messages stored in MongoDB. The frontend is built with Next.js and Axios, while the backend provides REST APIs and real-time communication.

The project is fully deployed with:

Frontend: Vercel

Backend: Render

Database: MongoDB Atlas
